# Graph RAG JavaScript Integration Test

This example demonstrates the successful integration between the `@graphrag-js/graph-retriever` and `@graphrag-js/langchain-graph-retriever` packages.

## What We've Accomplished

### 1. Graph Retriever Package (`@graphrag-js/graph-retriever`)
- ✅ Complete TypeScript conversion from Python
- ✅ Core traversal functionality (`traverse` and `atraverse`)
- ✅ Node and Content type definitions
- ✅ Multiple traversal strategies (Eager, Scored)
- ✅ Edge definitions and metadata edge functions
- ✅ In-memory adapter implementation
- ✅ Mathematical utilities (cosine similarity, top-k selection)
- ✅ Comprehensive test suite
- ✅ ES Module output format

### 2. LangChain Graph Retriever Package (`@graphrag-js/langchain-graph-retriever`)
- ✅ GraphRetriever class extending LangChain's BaseRetriever
- ✅ Adapter inference system for various vector stores
- ✅ Document-to-content conversion utilities
- ✅ Document graph creation functionality
- ✅ Integration with LangChain's retriever ecosystem
- ✅ ES Module compatibility
- ✅ Full TypeScript type safety

### 3. Key Features Working
- ✅ Vector similarity search
- ✅ Graph traversal based on metadata edges
- ✅ Multiple traversal strategies
- ✅ Document conversion between formats
- ✅ Full TypeScript type safety
- ✅ Modular architecture
- ✅ Test coverage

## Example Usage

The example demonstrates:

1. **Content Creation**: Converting text into structured content with embeddings and metadata
2. **Adapter Setup**: Using the in-memory adapter for quick testing
3. **Edge Definition**: Connecting documents based on metadata fields (category matching)
4. **Strategy Configuration**: Using the Eager strategy for breadth-first traversal
5. **Query Execution**: Performing similarity search combined with graph traversal
6. **Result Processing**: Getting LangChain-compatible Document objects

## Integration Success

The test shows that:
- Documents are properly retrieved based on both similarity and graph connections
- Metadata is preserved and enhanced with traversal information
- The depth and similarity scores are correctly calculated
- The system can handle complex document relationships
- Everything works seamlessly with LangChain's retriever interface

This demonstrates a complete, working Graph RAG system in JavaScript/TypeScript that can be integrated into larger LangChain applications.
